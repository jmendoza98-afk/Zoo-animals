        Bears (Ursus species) are large, four-legged mammals that have a unique status in pop culture. They are not quite as cuddly as dogs or cats; not quite as dangerous as wolves or mountain lions; but they are decidedly ever-compelling objects of fear, admiration, and even envy. Found in a variety of environments from Arctic ice pack to tropical forests, bears live on every continent except Antarctica. Bears are seen as one of the main attractions of zoos, as people tend to flock to see bears for their perceived strength and resilience. Our bears Ollie and Mona share the same aspects and characteristics that bears out in the wild have.

    <h2> Giraffes</h2>

        The tallest land mammal, with a neck as long as 6 feet, the giraffe is also well known for the unique brown and white pattern on its coat (“pelage”) and its lengthy eyelashes and legs. Giraffes use both semi-arid savannah and savannah woodlands in Africa. Giraffes are found in fragmented habitats scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Giraffe pregnancy usually lasts about 15 months, with two-year intervals between births. Giraffes have experienced severe habitat loss and fragmentation as a result of the expansion of human activities into their habitats. Uncontrolled timber harvest, the conversion of native habitat for agricultural development, mining, poor land-use planning, and urban expansion have all played a role in the loss and degradation of giraffe habitats. Which is why we have two of our own here, Frankie and Coconut. The habitat provided to them is nearly identical to the ones wild giraffes live in. Here, you can get and up close and personal look at how they live and feed.

    <h3> Lions </h3>

        African lions have been admired throughout history for as symbols of courage and strength. These iconic animals have powerful bodies—in the cat family, they’re second in size only to tigers—and lion roars that can be heard from five miles away. An adult lion’s coat is yellow-gold, and juveniles have some light spots that disappear with age. Only male lions typically boast manes, the impressive fringe of long hair that encircles their heads. Like most of the animals here at our zoo, the natural habitats of lions have slowly been degraded and destroyed by human interference. As such, we have a lion pair here, Mella and Karl. Although not in the wild, there habitat here is a near one to one model of what it is in the wild, allowing our lions to live a life like those lios that are currently lving in the African wildlands. Not to mention having top of the line care and food avaliable giving to them whenever they make their needs apparent.

     <h4> Monkeys</h4>

            Monkeys are a group of mammals that belong to the primate Order. They are characterised by their long limbs and tails, which help them to swing between trees. Most monkeys, unlike their relatives the great apes, spend the majority of their time in tree canopies, where they eat fruit and berries and avoid predators like jaguars and snakes. With a reputation for being cheeky and playful, monkeys have entertained humans for centuries. But their fast reactions and smart thinking didn't evolve for our amusement as their adaptations to living in complex societies in the treetops. Monkeys are a diverse group of mammals that usually live in large, social groups and display complex and interesting behaviours. Monkeys are very social and as such we have 3 monkeys here in the form of Cookie, Earl, and Banana Pudding. Together, the 3 of them have so far managed quite a bit of mischief, but none that we can't handle.

    <h5> Alligators </h5>

            Both males and females have an "armored" body with a muscular, flat tail. The skin on their back is armored with embedded bony plates called osteoderms or scutes. They have four short legs; the front legs have five toes while the back legs have only four toes. Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have dark stripes on the tail. The American alligator is found across the southeastern United States, ranging from the northern coasts of North Carolina to Lake Worth in central Texas. Alligators are usually found in freshwater, slow-moving rivers. They also live in swamps, marshes and lakes. They can only tolerate salt water for brief periods because they do not have salt glands. Our gators here are very representative of water alligators are like in the swamp lands, as their zoo habitat is as close to an accurate represenation of what they would face in the wild.
